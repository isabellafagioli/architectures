# VTEX Brand Guidelines Skill

Apply VTEX's official visual identity and voice standards when generating documents, presentations, proposals, and any branded artifacts.

Sources: [brand.vtex.com](https://brand.vtex.com/) (marketing brand) · [styleguide.vtex.com](https://styleguide.vtex.com/) (product/admin design system)

**Two distinct systems — do not mix them:**
- **Brand identity** (this file): marketing, presentations, proposals, documents → Rebel Pink, Serious Black, VTEX Trust font
- **Product UI** (`references/product-ui-tokens.md`): Admin screen mockups, demo UIs → Action Blue `#134CD8`, semantic states

---

## Core Brand Identity

VTEX's brand is built around three personality traits that must always remain in balance:

- **Bold** — fresh and transformative, not immature
- **Trustworthy** — technically authoritative, not pretentious
- **Optimistic** — confident about the future, not naive

The brand revolves around the customer as protagonist. VTEX is always the guide, never the hero.

**Current positioning (2026):** VTEX presents itself as *"The AI-Native Commerce Suite"* and *"The Composable and Complete Commerce Platform"*. Brand architecture spans three platforms: **VTEX Commerce Platform**, **VTEX CX Platform**, and **VTEX Ads Platform**. Use this framing in cover slides and executive summaries.

## Logo Assets (bundled in `assets/`)

The official VTEX logo (mark + wordmark, viewBox 0 0 80 29, aspect ratio ~2.76:1) is bundled in three color variants:

| File | Use on |
|---|---|
| `assets/vtex-logo-rebel-pink.svg` / `.png` | Light backgrounds (white, Soft Blue) — default |
| `assets/vtex-logo-serious-black.svg` / `.png` | Light backgrounds when pink would clash |
| `assets/vtex-logo-white.svg` / `.png` | Dark backgrounds (Serious Black, Rebel Pink) |

**Format selection:**
- `.svg` → HTML, Marp, web embeds (crisp at any size)
- `.png` → python-pptx and docx (960px wide, high-res; python-pptx cannot embed SVG)

**Rules:**
- Include the logo on every slide/page unless explicitly told not to
- Position: **top-left or bottom-left**
- Minimum size: 60px wide (digital) / 1cm (print)
- Clearspace: keep at least the height of the "V" mark clear around the logo
- Never distort, rotate, recolor outside the three variants, add shadows, or place inside shapes
- Never pair the pink logo on a Rebel Pink background (use white variant)

## Quick Color Reference (Brand)

| Name | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Rebel Pink | `#F71963` | Primary brand color, main accent |
| Serious Black | `#142032` | Dark backgrounds, headlines on light |
| Plain White | `#FFFFFF` | Balance color, clean backgrounds |
| Soft Blue | `#F5F9FF` | Balance color, subtle backgrounds |
| Winter Gray | `#E7E9EE` | Dividers, borders |
| Cool Gray | `#A1A8B7` | Secondary text |
| Serious Gray | `#5B6E84` | Supporting text |
| Soft Pink | `#FFF3F6` | Pink tint backgrounds |
| Bubble Gum Pink | `#FFC4DD` | Pink accent |
| Heavy Rebel Pink | `#DD1659` | Hover/pressed states on pink elements |

**Critical rules:**
- Never combine Rebel Pink and Serious Black as primary colors simultaneously in the same composition — one leads, the other supports minimally or not at all
- Maintain WCAG AA contrast between text and background

## Quick Typography Reference

| Element | Size Ratio | Line Height | Alignment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heading | Base × 1.5ⁿ | 100% | Left |
| Subheading | Base × 1.5ⁿ | 120% | Left |
| Body | Base | 150% | Left |

- **Font:** VTEX Trust (custom family, single weight philosophy). Download from [brand.vtex.com](https://brand.vtex.com/)
- **Fallback stack:** `'VTEX Trust', system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif`
- **Weight:** Regular by default. Bold and italic permitted in body text only for emphasis — never in titles
- **Case:** Never use all-caps or fully bold titles
- **Letter spacing:** Never alter

## Document and Presentation Generation

### Output Formats

| Use case | Recommended format |
|---|---|
| Formal client deliverable | python-pptx → `.pptx` |
| Internal presentation | Marp markdown → `.pdf` or `.html` |
| Web embed / demo | HTML + inline CSS |
| Google Slides | Export Marp or manually styled |

### python-pptx Pattern (for .pptx output)

```python
from pptx import Presentation
from pptx.util import Inches, Pt
from pptx.dml.color import RGBColor

REBEL_PINK    = RGBColor(0xF7, 0x19, 0x63)
SERIOUS_BLACK = RGBColor(0x14, 0x20, 0x32)
PLAIN_WHITE   = RGBColor(0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF)
COOL_GRAY     = RGBColor(0xA1, 0xA8, 0xB7)
SERIOUS_GRAY  = RGBColor(0x5B, 0x6E, 0x84)
SOFT_BLUE     = RGBColor(0xF5, 0xF9, 0xFF)

prs = Presentation()
prs.slide_width  = Inches(13.33)   # 16:9
prs.slide_height = Inches(7.5)

# Logo embedding — use the bundled PNGs (path relative to this skill)
LOGO_PINK  = "assets/vtex-logo-rebel-pink.png"   # light slides
LOGO_WHITE = "assets/vtex-logo-white.png"        # dark/pink slides

def add_logo(slide, variant=LOGO_PINK, top_left=True):
    w = Inches(1.2)  # aspect 80:29 → height auto
    left = Inches(0.5)
    top  = Inches(0.4) if top_left else prs.slide_height - Inches(0.9)
    slide.shapes.add_picture(variant, left, top, width=w)
```

**Slide types to implement:**

1. **Cover slide** — Serious Black background, Rebel Pink accent line or block, white headline, **white logo** top-left
2. **Section divider** — Rebel Pink background, white text, **white logo**
3. **Content slide** — White or Soft Blue background, Serious Black headlines, Serious Gray body, **pink logo**
4. **Data/chart slide** — White background, Rebel Pink as primary data color, Serious Black labels, **pink logo**
5. **Closing slide** — Mirror of cover

For full slide builder functions, see `references/pptx-generation.md`.

### Marp / HTML Pattern

```markdown
---
marp: true
theme: default
style: |
  section {
    background: #F5F9FF;
    font-family: 'VTEX Trust', system-ui, sans-serif;
    color: #142032;
  }
  section.cover { background: #142032; color: #FFFFFF; }
  section.pink  { background: #F71963; color: #FFFFFF; }
  h1 { color: #142032; line-height: 1.0; }
  h2 { color: #5B6E84; line-height: 1.2; }
  p  { line-height: 1.5; }
---
```

For HTML, inline the SVG logo directly (copy contents of the appropriate `assets/*.svg`) or reference the file.

---

## Layout and Composition Rules

- Use an **even number of columns** (symmetrical grid)
- Margins: ¼ column width; gutters: ¼ margin width
- **Anchor content to bottom, then top, fill middle**
- Prioritize white space — avoid crowded compositions
- Left-align text consistently; center alignment only in specific slide/web contexts
- Maintain strong contrast between text and background (WCAG AA minimum)

---

## Brand Voice in Text Content

- Open with the audience's pain point, not with VTEX capabilities
- Position VTEX as guide, the customer as protagonist
- Keep language simple and direct — no jargon without explanation
- Balance boldness, trustworthiness, and optimism across the document
- Never open a sentence with "VTEX is the solution" — reframe around what the customer achieves
